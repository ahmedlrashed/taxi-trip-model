#  Yellow Taxi Trip Prediction Model
 This project goal is to build a regression model that predicts taxi cab fares before each ride based on distance, time of day, and any additional variables we find necessary.

# 1 | Exploring the Dataset
The goal of this first notebook is to perform a cursory inspection of  the 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip data.

After looking at the dataset, the two variables that are most likely to help build a predictive model for taxi ride fares are total_amount and trip_distance because those variables show a picture of a taxi cab ride.


# 2 | Statistical Analysis
The goal of this second notebook is to characterize and clean the 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip data set and to create a visualization to share to stakeholders.
 - We will use box plots to determine outliers and where the bulk of the data points reside in terms of trip_distance, duration, and total_amount
 - We will use scatter plots to visualize the trends and patters and outliers of critical variables, such as trip_distance and total_amount
 - We will use bar charts to determine average number of trips per month, weekday, weekend, etc.
